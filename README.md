_DeFi Guru - Manages your money wisely._

A DeFi Portfolio Manager to Create, Manage, and Promote Your Crypto Assets.

## Description

DeFi Guru is a platform featuring multiple AI agents to help users invest and earn profits using cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum ecosystem. The main aim of the platform is to provide users with profitable opportunities through various DeFi operations such as swapping tokens, adding liquidity, approving ERC20 tokens, and more.

The platform leverages AI agents built using LangChain and LangGraph to analyze market data, execute trades, and automate tasks without unnecessary user intervention. Agents collaborate autonomously to complete tasks efficiently, ensuring seamless execution while keeping technical complexities hidden from the user.

- **Trade Execution Agent**: Executes trades like swapping tokens on Uniswap, buying NFTs, lending, and creating liquidity pools.
- **AI Agent Collaboration**: Uses LangGraph for dynamic task routing and agent coordination.

- **Modular and Scalable**: Easily integrate new agents (e.g., Discord, Telegram, analytics) without restructuring workflows.
